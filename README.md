InstaSearch is an  [Eclipse IDE](http://eclipse.org) plug-in for performing quick and advanced search of workspace files. It indexes files using [Lucene](http://lucene.apache.org/core/) and keeps the index up to date automatically. The search is performed instantly as-you-type and resulting files are displayed in an Eclipse view.

Each file then can be previewed using few most matching and relevant lines. A double-click on the match leads to the matching line in the file.

Search Tips

[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/ajermakovics/eclipse-instasearch](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/ajermakovics/eclipse-instasearch?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)
Lucene [query syntax](http://lucene.apache.org/core/old_versioned_docs/versions/3_0_0/queryparsersyntax.html) can be used for searching. This includes:

* Wildcard searches
  * `app* initialize`
* Excluding words
  * `application -initialize`
* Fuzzy searches to find similar matches
   * `application init~`
* Limit by location - directory, projects or working set
   * `proj:MyProject,OtherProject  application  init `
   * `ws:MyWorkingSet  dir:src  init `
* Limit by filename, extension or modification time
   * `name:app*  ext:java,xml,txt  modified:yesterday  `
* Search by file name initials (e.g. FOS to find FileOutputStream.java)
   * `name:FOS`

To exclude some folders from search indexing, mark them as *Derived* in the folder's properties.
There are also useful [Eclipse Search Tips](https://github.com/ajermakovics/eclipse-instasearch/wiki/Eclipse-search-tips).

**Note**: Fuzzy search is started automatically if no exact matches are found
